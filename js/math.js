//STEP 1:Create an application that prompts the user for a number. Regardless of whether they enter a negative or positive number, make sure to display the positive version of that number in the console window. If I enter -15 in the prompt and -15 is displayed in the console window, you did this one wrong.
    // let uNum = prompt(`Please enter a number.`);
    // let pos  = Math.abs(uNum);
    // alert(`Here's your result: ${pos}`);

//STEP 2:Create an application that prompts the user for a floating point value (decimal). Store the result of that input in a variable and then round it up to the nearest whole number. Display the result within a console window.
    // let uNum = prompt(`Please enter a floating point value.`);
    // let result = Math.ceil(uNum);
    // console.log(`Here's your entry, ${uNum}, rounded-up to the next integer: ${result}`);

//STEP 3:Create an application that prompts the user for a floating point value (decimal). Store the result of that input in a variable and then round it down to the nearest whole number. Display the result within a console window.
    // let uNum = prompt(`Please enter a floating point value.`);
    // let result = Math.floor(uNum);
    // console.log(`Here's your entry, ${uNum}, rounded-down to the nearest integer: ${result}`);

//STEP 4:Create an application that prompts the user for 5 numbers. Ask them to comma delimit each number so you get 1,2,3,4,5 for example. Store the result of that input in a variable and then find the largest and smallest numbers in that list. Display both of those numbers within a console window.
   
    // let Uarray = prompt(`Please enter 5 numbers, separated by commas. \nEXAMPLE: 1,2,3,4,5`);
    // var nArray = Uarray.split(',').map(Number);
    // let lg = Math.max(...nArray);
    // let sm = Math.min(...nArray);
    // console.log(`The largest number is: ${lg}.`);
    // console.log((`The smallest number is: ${sm}.`));


//STEP 5:Create an application that prompts the user for a number. Now find the square root of that number and display the result within a console window. 

    // let num  = prompt('Please enter a number. I will calculate the square root of the number you enter.')
    // let calc = Math.sqrt(num).toFixed(3);
    // console.log(`The square root (to 3 decimal places) of ${num} is ${calc}.`)
